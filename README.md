# Shopify-Script
Write a javascript function which we can copy & paste in browser developer console (F12 tools) 
- The function should take an integer parameter. 
- If input = 1 then places a button with the same style as “add to cart” button ABOVE the “add to cart” button. 
- If input = 2 then places a button with the same style as “add to cart” BELOW the “add to cart” button. 
- If input = 3 then places a button with the same style as “add to cart” BELOW the “buy with paypal” button. 
- The new button text should be “Gifted Button”. 
- When clicking the button, it should ‘console.log()’ the correct “variant id” of the product. 

``` 
function placeGiftedButton(location) { 
// your logic 
} 
```
